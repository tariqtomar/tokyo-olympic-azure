# End-to-End Data Engineering Project on Microsoft Azure

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive data engineering solution built on Microsoft Azure. It involves extracting, transforming, and analyzing a dataset using various Azure services. The project uses the Olympic dataset from Kaggle, which includes information about athletes, coaches, medals, teams, and gender entries.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction
- **Tool:** Azure Data Factory
- **Description:** Data is extracted from the Kaggle Olympic dataset using Azure Data Factory. A pipeline is created to automate the extraction process.
- **Outcome:** Raw data is loaded into Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen 2).

### 2. Data Storage
- **Tool:** Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen 2)
- **Description:** The raw data is stored securely in Azure Data Lake Storage. This storage solution supports both structured and unstructured data, providing scalability for large datasets.

### 3. Data Transformation
- **Tool:** Azure Databricks
- **Description:** The raw data is cleaned, transformed, and processed using Apache Spark within Azure Databricks. Key transformations include removing duplicates, cleaning data, and applying business logic.
- **Outcome:** Transformed data is stored back into Azure Data Lake Storage.

### 4. Data Analysis
- **Tool:** Azure Synapse Analytics
- **Description:** The transformed data is analyzed using SQL queries in Azure Synapse Analytics. The analysis focuses on extracting insights such as medal counts per country.
- **Outcome:** Analytical results that provide insights into the Olympic data.

### 5. Data Visualization
- **Tools:** Power BI, Tableau, or Looker Studio
- **Description:** Insights derived from the data analysis are visualized using dashboards created in Power BI, Tableau, or Looker Studio. These visualizations help in better understanding the data trends and insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Azure Data Factory**: Data integration and pipeline automation
- **Azure Data Lake Storage (Gen 2)**: Scalable data storage
- **Azure Databricks**: Data transformation using Apache Spark

2. Extract the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to Azure Data Lake Storage.
3. Create an Azure Data Factory pipeline to automate the data extraction process.
4. Use Azure Databricks to clean and transform the data.
5. Analyze the transformed data using Azure Synapse Analytics.
6. Visualize the results using Power BI, Tableau, or Looker Studio.

## Project Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the steps in the [project workflow](#project-workflow) to set up and execute the pipeline.
3. Ensure you have the necessary Azure services active and configured.

## Conclusion
This project is a practical demonstration of how to build an end-to-end data engineering solution on Azure. It highlights the integration and power of Azure services in handling large-scale data processing and analysis.
